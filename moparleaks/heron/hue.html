<h2>The Stork Inn at Conder Green</h2>
<p>The Stork is a delightful traditional English Country Inn and B and B, situated in the picturesque hamlet of Conder Green. 3½ miles from Lancaster with its castles & museums and located on the estuary of the River Lune where it meets the River Conder. This traditional beamed coaching inn dates back to 1660.
<p>In winter, you will find roaring log fires and a warm & friendly welcome from the cold. In summer you will find beautiful gardens, a large children’s play area and a BBQ with a South African influence.
<p>Traditional hand pulled real ales officially accredited by “Cask Marque”, quality wine & excellent coffee from J. Atkinson & Co of Lancaster are included in the modern day Stork offering.

<h2>Stork within the IRC Community</h2>
<p>
Despite being two unique and established organisations, Stork and Heron are often confused with eachother,<br>
The similar physical appearance and almost identical behaviour traits lead to rookie users of IRC channels to believe<br>
Storks are also Herons.<br>
